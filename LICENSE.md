## Third-Party Dependencies and License Compatibility

This software depends on the following third-party libraries, each with their own licensing terms:

### Compatible Dependencies (Permissive Licenses)

| Library | License | Compatibility |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **python-dotenv** | BSD 3-Clause | ‚úÖ Compatible with MIT |
| **weasyprint** | BSD 3-Clause | ‚úÖ Compatible with MIT |
| **pdfkit** | MIT-compatible | ‚úÖ Compatible with MIT |
| **xhtml2pdf** | Apache 2.0-compatible | ‚úÖ Compatible with MIT |

### GPL Dependency

| Library | License | Usage Model |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **html2text** | GPL 3.0 or later | üîÑ Dynamic dependency (pip install) |

**Important:** `html2text` is used as an external dependency installed via pip. This is generally considered acceptable usage that does not trigger GPL copyleft requirements for the main application.

## GPL Dependency Considerations

### Dynamic Linking Model

This software uses `html2text`, which is licensed under GPL 3.0. Key considerations:

1. **Separate Installation** - `html2text` is installed as an independent package via pip
2. **No Code Mixing** - The main codebase does not include `html2text` source code
3. **Runtime Dependency** - Used only at runtime through Python imports
4. **No Modifications** - `html2text` is used as-is without modifications

### Alternative Options

Users concerned about GPL compatibility may substitute `html2text` with:
- **BeautifulSoup** with custom text extraction
- **Custom HTML parsing** solutions
- **Other permissively-licensed** HTML-to-text converters

### Compliance Guidelines

- ‚úÖ **Using as pip dependency** - No GPL obligations for your code
- ‚ùå **Modifying html2text source** - Would require GPL 3.0 licensing for modifications
- ‚ùå **Statically bundling html2text** - Would trigger GPL copyleft requirements
